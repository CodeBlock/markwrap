* Now instantiates the underlying [Pegdown][] parser with the `HARDWRAPS`
  option disabled, ensuring that hard linewraps in the Markdown source are
  _not_ propagated automatically to the generated HTML. This is more
  consistent with common usage. To force a newline, use two or more spaces
  at the end of a line.
* When calling `MarkWrap.parserFor()` on Markdown, the underlying code
  returned an object that allocated a new Pegdown processor each time
  `parseToHTML()` was called. That's silly, so the object now allocates a
  Pegdown processor when it's allocated and re-uses it. Note that this
  change makes the returned Markdown parser object *not* thread-safe, since
  Pegdown is not thread-safe. (Just allocate one parser per thread, if
  you're threading.)
